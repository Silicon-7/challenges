# Challenges for the Break

While you are enjoying your break, it is important to keep your skills fresh. Here are three challenges that should keep you busy. Highest priority is File Search Challenge, then Sudoku, then Order Taker.

1. [File Search Challenge](search_challenge.md)

2. [Sudoku Challenge](sudoku_challenge.md)

3. [Order Taker Challenge](order_taker_challenge.md)

Start a new GitHub repo for each challenge.

### When you finish the challenges

- Use deliberate practice to prevent loosing your awesome core ruby skills. Keep coding for a bare minimum of an hour every three days but you can do more.
- Also start up a side project, something fun that gets you excited about diving into code or a tool that you could use for daily life or a tool for looking for jobs (automailer, contact tracker, scheduler, form organizer, etc) - you could work as a team to build this system if you so choose. Having a side project also helps when you talk to people about what you are currently working on.
