# File Search Challenge

Write a program in Ruby that emulates the use of a database. However, you will not be using a database. You will be given [file.txt](file.txt) and you will need to search this file much as you would search a database. 

## Goal 

In the terminal, your program should be able to answer the following questions (and more):

Can Bob Jones see the file named 'actual_notes.txt'?

What are the IDs of the investors who can see the file named 'super_secret_meeting_notes_jan.pdf'?

## Guidelines

Use the terminal to display prompts and information. 

Use a file named runner.rb to start your Ruby program in the terminal.

Do not use a DB or an ORM.

Do not create a Rails project.

If records are added to or removed from file.txt, your code should still work.

A testing framework is the only gem or outside code you may use.

Prove that it works with as much testing as is necessary with RSPEC (optional).

Make the terminal prompts and views as user friendly as possible.

## Screen Shots

Your terminal does not have to look like this, but here are some guidelines:
